# 🔧 Alert Tuning

Alert tuning improves **signal-to-noise ratio** and ensures SOC analyst efficiency.

## 🧩 Tuning Steps

1. **Baseline Analysis** – Identify normal activity patterns.  
2. **Threshold Adjustment** – Tune detection thresholds to reduce false positives.  
3. **Exclusion Rules** – Exclude benign sources/processes where appropriate.  
4. **Correlation** – Combine multiple events to reduce noise and increase confidence.  
5. **Periodic Review** – Reassess every 3-6 months or after major incidents.

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Maintain version control for all tuning changes.  
- Document reasoning for thresholds and exclusions.  
- Use SOC feedback to guide improvements.  
- Automate tuning where possible using historical data or ML models.
