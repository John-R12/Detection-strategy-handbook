# 🎯 Detection Strategy Handbook

The **Detection Strategy Handbook** provides a structured approach for designing, implementing, and improving security detections.  
It connects **Threat Intelligence**, **Threat Hunting**, and **Detection Engineering** practices to achieve effective, resilient defense.

---

## 🧩 Purpose

This repository helps SOC and detection engineers to:

- Understand the **Detection Lifecycle** (from hypothesis to validation).  
- Align detections with **MITRE ATT&CK** and adversary behaviors.  
- Design and document detection **use cases** and **coverage strategies**.  
- Establish metrics for **detection quality, performance, and resilience**.  
- Build a sustainable and measurable detection engineering program.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Start with [`foundations/detection-lifecycle.md`](./foundations/detection-lifecycle.md).  
2. Explore `design/` to learn how to turn intelligence into detection hypotheses.  
3. Follow `implementation/` guidelines for consistent, versioned detection development.  
4. Use `evaluation/` to assess detection performance and coverage.  
5. Refer to `references/` for community frameworks and research.
