# 🧭 Detection Strategy Handbook

The **Detection Strategy Handbook** is a practical guide for designing, deploying, and maintaining **effective detection engineering programs**.  
It helps SOCs, CERTs, and Detection Engineers align detections with real-world threats, improve coverage, and maintain operational excellence over time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides structured guidance to:
- Define a **detection strategy** aligned with threats and business risk.  
- Design and document **detection logic** using industry frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, Sigma, etc.).  
- Operationalize detections through monitoring, tuning, and continuous improvement.  
- Measure detection performance with clear **KPIs and governance** practices.  
- Institutionalize **Detection-as-Code** workflows for repeatability and auditability.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `strategy/` | Defines the overall detection vision, goals, and prioritization framework. |
| `design/` | Details detection logic design, ATT&CK mapping, and coverage modeling. |
| `operations/` | Covers lifecycle management: monitoring, tuning, KPIs, and continuous improvement. |
| `governance/` | Focuses on ownership, documentation, and process control for detections. |
| `references/` | Provides curated sources, frameworks, and community resources. |

## 🧩 How to Use

1. **Start with `strategy/`** to define what to detect, why, and in what order (threat- and risk-driven).  
2. **Move to `design/`** to translate strategic intent into technical logic and coverage maps.  
3. **Apply `operations/`** to maintain detection health, measure efficiency, and improve continuously.  
4. **Refer to `governance/`** to formalize ownership, versioning, and documentation.  
5. **Use `references/`** for continuous learning and benchmarking against industry standards.

## ⚙️ Methodological Foundations

This handbook is based on:
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — for adversary TTP mapping and coverage planning.  
- **Detection-as-Code** — to treat detections as versioned, testable assets.  
- **Continuous Detection Improvement (CDI)** — integrating feedback loops from SOC, IR, and Red Teams.  
- **Kaizen & PDCA** — to embed iterative improvement and governance discipline.

## 📊 Key Outcomes

By applying this handbook, you can:
- Build a **strategic detection roadmap** aligned with your threat landscape.  
- Improve **signal-to-noise ratio** and analyst trust in alerts.  
- Achieve **quantifiable coverage** of ATT&CK tactics and techniques.  
- Establish measurable **detection performance metrics**.  
- Foster a **culture of collaboration and continuous learning**.
