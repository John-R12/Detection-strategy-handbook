# 🗺️ Detection Roadmap

The **Detection Roadmap** translates your organization’s detection goals into a clear, time-bound plan.  
It ensures that detection efforts evolve systematically — from foundational coverage to advanced behavioral analytics.

## 🧩 Phased Approach

| Phase | Focus | Typical Outputs |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Phase 1 – Foundational Coverage** | Log ingestion, baseline detections, visibility validation. | Data source mapping, initial detection catalog |
| **Phase 2 – Threat-Driven Detections** | Focus on top adversaries and prevalent TTPs. | ATT&CK mapping, prioritized detection backlog |
| **Phase 3 – Behavior Analytics** | Contextual correlation, anomaly detection, ML-based hunting. | Advanced correlation rules, behavior models |
| **Phase 4 – Continuous Improvement** | Feedback, tuning, and automation of detection lifecycle. | Detection KPIs, tuning playbooks, automation scripts |

## 🧠 Example Timeline

| Quarter | Key Deliverables |
|----------|------------------|
| Q1 | Baseline detections (auth, process creation, network flow). |
| Q2 | Implement detection coverage for top 10 MITRE techniques. |
| Q3 | Deploy detection-as-code repository and CI/CD testing. |
| Q4 | Establish detection tuning and review board. |

> Start small, iterate fast, and continuously validate the value of each detection.

## 📈 Success Indicators
- ≥ 80% of top attack paths covered by active detections.  
- Defined ownership and maintenance per detection.  
- Detections validated through purple team exercises.  
- Monthly detection health and false positive metrics reported.
