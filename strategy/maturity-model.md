# 📈 Detection Maturity Model

The **Detection Maturity Model (DMM)** measures how advanced and effective your detection capability is.  
It provides a roadmap for growth — from ad-hoc detections to fully engineered, threat-aligned coverage.

## 🧩 Levels of Maturity

| Level | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Level 1 – Reactive** | Ad-hoc detections, no formal ownership. | Alerts mostly from vendor defaults; no tuning. |
| **Level 2 – Structured** | Defined process and detection catalog. | Basic ATT&CK mapping, initial coverage tracking. |
| **Level 3 – Threat-Driven** | Detections aligned to known adversary TTPs. | Prioritized backlog, CTI integration. |
| **Level 4 – Engineered** | Detections as code, version-controlled, and tested. | CI/CD pipelines, validation frameworks. |
| **Level 5 – Optimized** | Continuous improvement with measurable outcomes. | Feedback loops, coverage KPIs, automated health checks. |

## 📊 Assessment Dimensions

| Dimension | Indicators |
|------------|-------------|
| **Governance** | Ownership, documentation, review cadence. |
| **Coverage** | ATT&CK techniques, critical assets monitored. |
| **Quality** | Detection accuracy, false positive rates. |
| **Agility** | Ability to respond to new threats. |
| **Tooling** | Automation, detection-as-code adoption. |

## 📈 Using the Model
1. Evaluate your current level per dimension.  
2. Identify gaps and define next-level targets.  
3. Integrate maturity milestones into your detection roadmap.  

> Maturity is not about the number of detections — but the *effectiveness, relevance, and sustainability* of your detection program.
