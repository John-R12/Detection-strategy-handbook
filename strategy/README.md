# 🧭 Detection Strategy Overview

The **Detection Strategy** defines *what* to detect, *why* it matters, and *how* to prioritize detections based on risk, threat relevance, and mission impact.  

It provides the foundation for effective Detection Engineering — ensuring that every detection aligns with adversary behaviors and business context.

## 📊 Components

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| [`detection-roadmap.md`](./detection-roadmap.md) | Strategic roadmap linking detections to business and threat priorities. |
| [`threat-alignment.md`](./threat-alignment.md) | Mapping detection priorities to adversary TTPs and threat models. |
| [`prioritization-model.md`](./prioritization-model.md) | Framework to rank detection opportunities by impact and feasibility. |
| [`maturity-model.md`](./maturity-model.md) | Assessment tool for measuring and improving detection program maturity. |

## 🧩 How to Use
1. Define your **threat landscape and business risks**.  
2. Use the **prioritization model** to plan high-value detections first.  
3. Develop your **roadmap** for short-, medium-, and long-term goals.  
4. Periodically review your **maturity level** to identify gaps and growth areas.  

> A clear detection strategy transforms reactive alerting into proactive defense.
